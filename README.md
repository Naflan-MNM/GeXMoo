# 🛍️ GEXMOO — Modern E-Commerce Web Application

GEXMOO is a fully responsive and user-friendly e-commerce web application designed to provide a simple and smooth online shopping experience. It includes smart product filtering, recommendations, and complete cart management — all powered by React and Tailwind CSS.

This project was fully developed earlier as part of my learning and portfolio improvement. I am now restructuring and uploading the code to GitHub with a clean commit history to better demonstrate the development workflow and architecture.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
